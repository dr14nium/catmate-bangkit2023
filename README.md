## Project Description
CatMate is a project that aims to address the issue of stray cat overpopulation in Indonesia and the lack of awareness and resources for cat adoption. Stray cats face various challenges, including hunger, diseases, and vulnerability to abuse. By promoting cat adoption, we strive to provide these animals with loving homes, reduce the stray cat population, and educate the public about responsible pet ownership.
